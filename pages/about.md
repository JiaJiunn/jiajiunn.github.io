# **About Me**

Hi there! :wave:<br>

I am {{ site.author.name }}, a junior at Cornell University studying Computer Science and Statistics.

I am passionate about building software that is scalable and impactful. In the past, I have primarily worked on machine learning systems for autonomous cars and UAVs, both in industry, as an intern under <a href="https://www.argo.ai">Argo AI</a> and <a href="https://garuda.io">Garuda Robotics</a>, and in academia, as an undergraduate researcher under <a href="http://cornell-asl.org/main/projects.html">Cornell's Autonomous Systems Lab</a>. I have also worked on software for games (which can be downloaded <a href="http://en-ci-gdiac.coecis.cornell.edu/gallery/nite_bite/">here</a>), as well as healthcare, as an intern under <a href="https://poetsandquants.com/2020/10/23/2020-most-disruptive-mba-startups-hopscoth-cornell-university-johnson/?pq-ab-wall=b&pq-category=students
">Hopscotch</a>.
