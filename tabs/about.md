## Hi!

My name is Jiunn, and I am a junior at Cornell University studying Statistics and Computer Science. I'm excited abouts all things robotics and software engineering -- which is what this blog is primarily about!

In the past, I have interned at <a href="https://www.argo.ai">Argo AI</a>, where I worked on object detection systems for autonomous cars. I have also previously interned at <a href="https://garuda.io">Garuda Robotics</a>, where I developed the perception system for UAVs as a software engineering intern.

<!-- On campus, I currently work on perception and localization algorithms under <a href="https://resistanceracing.engineering.cornell.edu">Cornell Electric Vehicles</a>, a project team focused on building energy-efficient, autonomous electric vehicles. I also am a teaching assistant for the course <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4820/2020sp/">Introduction to Analysis of Algorithms</a>. -->

I mainly write about code and research papers, but also school and (sometimes) travelling. Feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:ja497@cornell.edu" starget="_blank">ja497@cornell.edu</a>!
