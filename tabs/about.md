## Hi!

My name is Jiunn, and I am a junior at Cornell University studying Statistics and Computer Science. I'm excited abouts all things robotics and software engineering -- which is what this blog is primarily about!

In the past, I have interned at <a href="https://www.argo.ai">Argo AI</a>, where I worked on object detection software for autonomous cars. I was also previously an intern at <a href="https://garuda.io">Garuda Robotics</a>, where I developed the perception system for UAVs as a software engineering intern. I currently work on computer vision research under Professor Mark Campbell in Cornell's <a href="http://cornell-asl.org/main/projects.html">Autonomous Systems Lab</a>. On campus, I also work on perception and localization software at <a href="https://resistanceracing.engineering.cornell.edu">Cornell Electric Vehicles</a>, and am a teaching assistant for the class <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4820/2020sp/">Introduction to Analysis of Algorithms</a>.

<!-- On campus, I currently work on perception and localization algorithms under c, a project team focused on building energy-efficient, autonomous electric vehicles. I also am a teaching assistant for the course <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4820/2020sp/">Introduction to Analysis of Algorithms</a>. -->

I mainly write about code and research papers, but also school and (sometimes) travelling. Feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:ja497@cornell.edu" starget="_blank">ja497@cornell.edu</a>!
