Hi there!

I am Jiunn, a junior at Cornell University studying Computer Science and Statistics. I created this blog with the primary intention of writing updates on projects I am working on -- usually something related to coding, or robotics -- but also sprinkled with occasional updates from my personal life, like school, or me learning how to ride an electric unicycle (which Iâ€™m currently working on). I just thought that this would be 
a good way to keep track of what I learned, as well as my thought process in between.

As an undergrad, my technical understanding might sometimes be skewed, or my implementations not optimal; but hopefully I'll get better at coding as I blog along and pen down my thoughts. Nevertheless, if you're interested in what I'm working on, feel free to read along! Any feedback or recommendations on improving any of my projects would also be greatly appreciated :)
