  from: Aug 2018
  to: Present
  description:  I coordinate a team of five to engineer training, evaluation, and deployment frameworks for computer vision models, 
                as part of the perception system for CEV's autonomous cars. Previously, I have also led the development of an onboard
                localization system, which fuses data from a GPS and IMU, and also implemented an RRT*-based path planning algorithm 
                to navigate obstacle maps in real time. 

- title: Teaching Assistant, Cornell University College of Engineering
  from: Jan 2019
  to: Present
  description:  I was a teaching assistant for computer science classes including Introduction to Analysis of Algorithms (Fall 2020), 
                Data Structures and Functional Programming (Spring 2020), Discrete Structures (Fall 2019), Introduction to Machine 
                Learning and Data Science (Spring 2019 - Spring 2020). I led discussion sections, graded student assignments, and 
                held weekly office hours, for class sizes of around 300-400 students.

  from: May 2020
  to: Aug 2020
  description:  I primarily worked on developing general obstacle detectors for autonomous cars. I implemented stixel-based computer 
                vision models from scratch, and integrated them within a distributed training framework for running training and evaluations 
                on Google Cloud Platform.

  from: May 2019
  to: Aug 2019
  description:  I developed and trained a MobileNet-based object recognition module via transfer learning, as part of the obstacle 
                avoidance system for medium-speed delivery UAVs. Additionally, I also built blob detection and optical flow-based 
                obstacle detection algorithms, and managed to achive an accurate detection range of up to 20m while travelling 5m/s.
